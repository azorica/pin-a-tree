# 🌳 Pin-a-Tree

**Pin-a-Tree** is a community-driven web app that encourages environmental awareness and tree conservation by allowing users to pin trees on a map. Whether it's a tree you’ve planted or just one you love, you can capture it, name it, and share it with the world.

## 🌱 Purpose

The goal of Pin-a-Tree is to create a digital forest — a living, growing map that celebrates the positive environmental actions of individuals and communities. It promotes environmental education, community engagement, and a sense of connection to nature.

## 📸 What Users Can Do

- **Upload a Tree Photo**  
  Take or upload a photo of a tree you planted or admire.

- **Provide Tree Info**  
  Add basic details (e.g. tree name, species, date planted — more TBA).

- **Auto-detect Location**  
  The app extracts the GPS coordinates from the photo’s metadata (EXIF). If missing, users can manually pin the location.

- **Pin to Map**  
  The tree appears on a collaborative Google Map with your photo and data.

- **View Others’ Trees**  
  Browse trees pinned by other users and explore a global map of green activity.
