# üßæ Product Definition ‚Äî Pin-a-Tree

## üåç Overview

**Pin-a-Tree** is a collaborative, eco-conscious platform that allows users to capture and share trees by uploading photos, entering details, and pinning them to a digital map. The platform aims to encourage sustainability, environmental education, and community involvement through a gamified and visually engaging tree-planting tracker.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

There is a growing global interest in climate action and reforestation efforts, but few digital tools provide a personal and social way to track these efforts. People plant trees ‚Äî but the stories, impact, and motivation often go undocumented or unnoticed.

---

## üå± Value Proposition

- Provides an easy and fun way to share tree-planting actions.
- Builds a global community of eco-conscious users.
- Helps users visually track environmental efforts over time.
- Acts as a tool for schools, NGOs, and city programs to engage audiences.

---

## üë§ User Types

- **Eco Enthusiast**: Wants to plant trees and track their contributions.
- **Teacher / Student**: Uses the app for environmental education.
- **Community Leader / NGO**: Documents and promotes local planting campaigns.
- **Nature Lover**: Pins beautiful or interesting trees discovered in nature.

---

## üíº Key Use Cases

- Upload a tree you just planted and share its info and location.
- Browse a map of global trees added by the community.
- Discover trees near your area or in specific regions.
- Use in classrooms or green programs to promote awareness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MVP Non-Negotiables

### üî¥ FEATURES THAT CANNOT BE MARKED "COMING SOON"

1. **Tree Upload Form**

   - This is the PRIMARY user value proposition
   - Users must be able to add trees to justify using the app
   - Core differentiator from other environmental apps

2. **Photo GPS Extraction**

   - Key technical differentiator and convenience feature
   - Reduces friction in the upload process
   - Essential for automated location detection

3. **Working Interactive Map (Leaflet)**

   - Essential for the "community" aspect of the platform

   - Core to the "digital forest" concept

4. **End-to-End Tree Creation**
   - Users must complete the full workflow successfully
   - Half-implemented features break user trust
   - MVP means "minimum VIABLE product" - it must work

### üö´ Implementation Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå "Feature coming soon" placeholders for core MVP features
- ‚ùå Non-functional forms that don't actually create trees

## üìù Developer Notes

### For AI Agents/Automated Development

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
When implementing Pin-a-Tree MVP, ALL features listed in
"MVP Definition of Done" must be fully functional.

Do NOT create placeholder components that say "coming soon"
for any feature marked as MVP-required.

The MVP must demonstrate the complete user value proposition:
Upload tree photo ‚Üí Auto-detect location ‚Üí Fill details ‚Üí
Submit successfully ‚Üí See tree on map immediately.
```

### Implementation Priority Order

1. **Photo upload with preview** (enables user journey start)
2. **EXIF GPS extraction** (core technical differentiator)
3. **Tree details form** (data collection for community)
4. **Leaflet map integration** (community discovery)
5. **End-to-end integration** (complete user value)
